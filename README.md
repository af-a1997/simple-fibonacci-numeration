# Simple Fibonacci numeration

This is a "simple" Java code with some extras to obtain the Fibonacci numeration, done as part of my course and personal practice.

Extras: uses `JOptionPane` library for input/display, handles a `NumberFormatException` in case the user enters a non-numeric option.

For suggestions, open a new issue, I'm willing to update this project anytime.
